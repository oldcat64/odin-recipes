            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. 
                Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. 
                Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks 
                with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and
                 generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 
                2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, 
                about 2 minutes more. 
                Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink
                 to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. 
                 An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 
                degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. 
                Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
